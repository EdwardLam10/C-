MakeFile Instructions:

make all: creates all the files needed to run programs

make clean: rm all the files that were created by make all.

For the run functions there will be arguments passed in through the command line.
for example:
	"make run file=test.txt" 
	will run the program as ./optimal_multiplications test.txt.
	please note that there are no spaces between the '='. The make commands are space sensitive!
